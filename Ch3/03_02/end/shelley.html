            <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
            <h2>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
         </section>
         <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br /> 
         Who said &ndash;&#8220;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br /> 
         Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br /> 
         Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br /> 
         And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br /> 
         Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br /> 
         Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br /> 
         The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</p> 
         
         <p>And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br /> 
         My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br />
         Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br /> 
         Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br /> 
         Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
         The lone and level sands stretch far away.&#8221;</p>
