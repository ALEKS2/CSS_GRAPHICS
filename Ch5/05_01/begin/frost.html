            <h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
            <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
         </div>
         <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />
            His house is in the village, though;<br />
            He will not see me stopping here<br />
            To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>

         <p>My little horse must think it queer<br />
            To stop without a farmhouse near<br />
            Between the woods and frozen lake<br />
            The darkest evening of the year.</p>

         <p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br />
            To ask if there is some mistake.<br />
            The only other soundâ€™s the sweep<br />
            Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

         <p>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,<br />
            But I have promises to keep,<br />
            And miles to go before I sleep,<br />
            And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
